    <h3>Lions live in prides consisting of females that stay there for life, and a adult male/males. When male lions reach adulthood they are forced out and often form a new group with thier cousins and brothers. The amount
    of food avaliable determines how big a pride will be. If food is low there will be less lions in a pride. If food is really low sometimes females forced out to find a new pride.

<h3>Lion population has declined in the past decade by 30 percent. It is estimated that 20,000 lions remain. Habitat loss, posioning, and hunting are some of the dangers lions face. As well as domestic dogs that live in the villages spread distemper which kills the lions.
    The lions that live in the Gir forest suffer from having a small habitat and frequenting coming in contact with people. They are threatened by growing infustructure, so they need more habitat to grow the poulation. You can help by while you are on vacation  by makeing sure to volunteer and help the different organizations helping the lions.
    You can also help by not bying animal prducts becuase this encourages illegal wildlife trade.
